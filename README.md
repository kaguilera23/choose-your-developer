# Choose Your Developer

## Description

As a team of developers gets bigger, it's hard to keep track of everyone on the team. This applications allows you to input new developers and managers, and displays the information underneath their name to contact them and see their GitHub.

## Usage

To use this application, you must install Node onto your computer. After this is complete, open up the terminal and install the Inquirer npm package using "npm i inquirer@8.2.4". Once this is done, you may type into your terminal "node index.js" to initialize the application and answer all questions regarding the team you would like to create. 

After you are done creating your team, you may navigate to the "dist" folder and see your newly created HTML file named "teamFile.html". If you open this file with a live server, you can view the cards associated with each of the team members you created. Clicking the links to the GitHub accounts will bring up their GitHub profiles in a separate tab.

## Tests

To test the application, you must download the Jest Library using npm i jest. once installed, you may type into the console "npm run test" to see if the functions within each class work as expected.

## Bugs

For now, the teams are hard-coded to have one manager, two engineers, and one intern because there was difficulty in created cards from the input data.
